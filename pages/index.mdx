hi there. my name is Scott, thank you for stopping by.

## full stack engineering

I am currently an Engineering Team Lead at [PatientIQ](https://www.patientiq.io/), where we're making patient outcome data more intelligent. my team is currently hiring full stack engineers.

In the past, I've worked as an engineering manager at [Compass](https://www.compass.com/), and as a team lead and IC at [Contactually](https://www.contactually.com/).

I have expertise scaling products and teams who build them. I am well versed in react.js and ruby on rails.

## tools for thought

I created [phonetonote](https://phonetonote.com), a software as a service that makes it easier to use tools for thought with your phone. you can learn more about [my personal note taking journey](https://phonetonote.com/blog/my-personal-note-taking-journey) and [phonetonote's architecture](https://kinopio.club/ptn-architecture-xZGPO_YKTEzcyvCcdPgVI).

I am interested in how [tools for thought can work better together](https://github.com/phonetonote/tft-interop), and recently built a [logseq plugin to create OPML based blogs](https://github.com/phonetonote/tft-interop/tree/main/logseq-opml-drummer) from inside logseq.

I believe [graphql can help enable data interop](https://kinopio.club/graphql-is-data-interop-PefqC1flrseiMQBWutD8L) amongst [tft graphs](https://kinopio.club/tft-graphs-HIC-1VtdhrGbpy2P7gsFq).

## sports analytics

I've done frontend development for [cleaning the glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/), and am generally interested in seeing sports through a data-first lens.

I have experience scraping sports data from the web, and using python to analyze it.

I have built linear and logistic models using scikit learn.

## entrepreneurship ecosystems

In college I cofounded [VentureBoard](https://www.elevationdcmedia.com/innovationnews/ventureboard_040213.aspx) and was one of the founding members of the [startup shell](https://startupshell.org/).

I strive to work in spaces that make me feel creative and energized.
